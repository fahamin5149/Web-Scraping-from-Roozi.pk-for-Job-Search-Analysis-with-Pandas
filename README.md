# Web-Scraping-from-Roozi.pk-for-Job-Search-Analysis-with-Pandas

<h2>1. Data Extraction:</h2>
<p>A script was developed to extract crucial information from online job listings from <a href="https://roozi.pk">roozi.pk</a> website. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Job titles</li>
  <li>Company names</li>
  <li>Job locations</li>
  <li>Gender preferences</li>
  <li>Age requirements</li>
  <li>Minimum education levels</li>
  <li>Experience details (if available)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data Organization:</h2>
<p>All the extracted data is neatly organized into a Pandas dataframe for easy manipulation and analysis. The dataframe also includes links to the job listings for quick access.</p>

<h2>3. Data Analysis:</h2>
<p>The script performs an in-depth analysis on the dataframe to match users with jobs that best suit their profile. This involves comparing user preferences and qualifications with job requirements.</p>

<p>This project demonstrates my proficiency in web scraping, data extraction, data organization, and data analysis using Python and Pandas. It's a comprehensive solution for job seekers to find the most suitable job opportunities.</p>
